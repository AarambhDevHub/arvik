## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

To report unacceptable behavior, use one of these channels:
- **Discord:** Join the [Aarambh Dev Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/HDth6PfCnp) and open a private message to the maintainer
- **GitHub:** Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/AarambhDevHub/arvik/security/advisories/new) for sensitive reports

---

## Getting Started

Arvik is a Rust workspace with 12 crates. Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with:

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — Full technical specification
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — Version-by-version development plan
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — What has changed so far

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.85+** — Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git** — For version control
- **curl** — For manual testing (optional)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AarambhDevHub/arvik.git
cd arvik

# Build all crates
cargo build --workspace

# Run all checks (what CI runs)
cargo check --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Running

```bash
# Start the development server
cargo run -p arvik

# Test it
curl http://localhost:8080
```

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find Something to Work On

- Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the current milestone
- Look for [open issues](https://github.com/AarambhDevHub/arvik/issues) tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Check if the feature you want is already planned in the roadmap
- Ask in the [Aarambh Dev Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/HDth6PfCnp) if you're unsure where to start

### 2. Fork and Branch

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arvik.git
cd arvik
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write code following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Keep changes focused — one feature/fix per PR

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the full CI suite locally
cargo check --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

See [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process) below.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** — If your change affects the public API, update relevant docs
2. **Add changelog entry** — Add a note under `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`
3. **Pass CI** — All checks must pass: `check`, `clippy`, `test`, `fmt`
4. **Write a clear description** — Explain what, why, and how
5. **Link issues** — Reference related issues with `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
6. **Request review** — Tag maintainers for review
7. **Address feedback** — Respond to review comments promptly

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit style:

```
feat(router): add radix trie path matching
fix(hyper): handle connection reset gracefully
docs(readme): update quick start example
test(extract): add Path<T> deserialization tests
refactor(core): simplify Body type alias
ci: add benchmark workflow
chore: update dependencies
```

---

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow the official [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `cargo fmt` with default settings (no custom `rustfmt.toml`)
- Zero `cargo clippy` warnings — CI enforces `-D warnings`
- Use `#[must_use]` on functions that return important values
- Use `#[inline]` sparingly — only on small, hot-path functions

### Documentation

- Every `pub` item must have a `///` doc comment
- Every crate must have a `//!` top-level doc comment
- Include `# Examples` sections for major types and functions
- Use `# Panics`, `# Errors`, `# Safety` sections where appropriate

### Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for library error types
- Never use `.unwrap()` in library code (only in tests and examples)
- Provide meaningful error messages that help users debug issues

### Performance

- Zero heap allocations on the hot path (routing, handler dispatch)
- Use `Bytes` and `BytesMut` instead of `Vec<u8>` for body data
- Benchmark before and after performance-related changes

### Testing

- Unit tests go in the same file as the code (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`)
- Integration tests go in `tests/` directory of each crate
- Use descriptive test names: `test_path_param_extraction_with_uuid`
- Test both success and failure paths

## Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks (dependencies, tooling) |
| `breaking` | Breaking API change |

### Scopes

Use the crate name without the `arvik-` prefix: `core`, `router`, `hyper`, `extract`, `middleware`, `ws`, `sse`, `static`, `tls`, `macros`, `test`.
